# Advanced Usage

In [Getting Started](../README.md#getting-started), we used simple OpenAPI specs to get you familiarized with how the spec works with extensions. Here, you will find a more in-depth guide on:
- How to configure Auth schemes in your OpenAPI spec
- Using parameters and variables
- Refs support
- Linking multiple extensions in your Actions skill

These topics will help you expand and exercise various capabilities of custom extensions, and hopefully will inspire more creative ways to use Watson Assistant through extensions.
