# Watson Assistant extension starter kits

These starter kits provide everything you need to create assistants that use custom extensions to access external services using REST APIs.

Each starter kit includes the following:

- A valid OpenAPI document describing the REST API of a third-party service. These OpenAPI documents have been tested and validated with Watson Assistant.

- A JSON file containing example actions that use the extension. You can import this file into an assistant and then edit these actions to access the extension you create.

More starter kits will be added in the future.
